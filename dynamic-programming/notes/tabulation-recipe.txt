Tabulation Recipe (from coderbyte Dynamic Programming Course)

1. visualize the problem as a table
2. size the table based on the inputs
3. Identify base cases for the problem
4. initialize the table with default values
5. seed the trivial answer into the table derived from base cases
6. iterate through the table
7. fill further positions based on the current position
