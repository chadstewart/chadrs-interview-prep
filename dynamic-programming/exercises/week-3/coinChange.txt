//Problem Statement

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

//Examples

coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11, ans = 3 (1+5+5)
coins = [1,2], amount = 3, ans = 2 (1+2)

//Example Notes

Don't need to return the combination of coins, just the number of lowest coins.

//Tests

coinChange(11, [1,2,5])
coinChange(3, [1,2,5])

//Proposed Procedure

1. Check if amount is > 0, if so return -1
2. Check if amount is 0, if so return 0
3. Create variable result and set it to -1;
4. Loop through coins array
  a. Create variable called counter and store result of recursively called function
  b. If counter is greater than -1
    i. if result is -1 or counter is less than result, add counter + 1 to result
5. Return result 

Proposed space complexity O(m) / time complexity O(m*n^m)

//Can this procedure be optimized?

Yes, there is a lot of duplicate work being done

//Optimized Procedure

1. Create table of size amount + 1 and fill with -1
2. Seed table[0] with 0
3. Loop through coins array
  a. If index of table is not 0 loop through coins array
    i. If index + coin less than table.length
      1. Check if element at index + coin is -1 or less than element at index + 1 and mark index + coin with element + 1 at index;
4. Return table[amount]

Optimized space complexity O(m) / time complexity  O(m*n^m)

//Solution Attempt:

/**
 * @param {number[]} coins
 * @param {number} amount
 * @return {number}
 */
var coinChange = function(coins, amount) {
  let table = Array(amount + 1).fill(-1);
  table[0] = 0;

  for(let i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
      if(table[i] > -1) {
          for(let coin of coins) {
              let newPosition = coin + i;
              if(newPosition < table.length) {
                  let numOfCoins = table[i] + 1;
                  if(table[newPosition] === -1 || numOfCoins < table[newPosition]) {
                      table[newPosition] = numOfCoins;
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }

  return table[amount];
};

//Testing Notes

Just need to really work on finding the correct base case when working on these problems. If that base case is wrong then the whole problem falls to pieces.

//Alternate Solution

1. Add memo object to function definition
2. Check if amount is in memo object
3. Check if amount is > 0, if so return -1
4. Check if amount is 0, if so return 0
5. Create variable result and set it to -1;
6. Loop through coins array
  a. Create variable called counter and store result of recursively called function
  b. If counter is greater than -1
    i. if result is -1 or counter is less than result, add counter + 1 to result
    ii. Add current result to amount in memo object
7. Return result 

var coinChange = function(coins, amount, memo = {}) {
    if(memo[amount]) return memo[amount];
    if(amount === 0) return 0;
    if(amount < 0) return -1;

    let result = -1;

    for(let coin of coins) {
        let count = coinChange(coins, amount - coin, memo);
        if(count > -1) {
            if(result === -1 || count < result) {
                result = count + 1;
                memo[amount] = result;
            }
        }
    }

    return memo[amount];
};
